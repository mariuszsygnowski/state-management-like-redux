# Redux without redux

When I learned how redux works, I did not like the concept a bit and asked myself if there is any other, easier way to transfer the state to all other components?
<b>YES!</b>
Full explanation is in each component.

## Technical notes

- Run `npm install` after cloning to download all dependencies
- Use `npm run dev -- --watch` to build React.
